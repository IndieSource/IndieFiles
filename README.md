## Who is Sharedigm For?

### 1. For Users

If you are a software user with some web hosting skills, then you can use Sharedigm to deploy your own platform to manage your own data.

- Manage your files, photos, music, code, your digital life. 
- Communicate with friends family and colleagues with discussion topics and private messages
- Play music, view photos, and watch videos
- Customize the look and feel of the platform to match your own personal brand with no coding required.

### 2. For Developers
If you are a developer, then you can use the Sharedigm OS to build new platforms.  Build cloud applications the smart, efficient way, rather than in the broken, disjointed, and archaic way that characterizes modern web development.  The platform can be easily customized with no coding required. Build cloud platforms like you build desktop applications by building on top of a true OS instead of re-inventing the wheel.

- Build your own platform by customizing the set of installed apps, configuration, branding, and theme to match your own needs.
- If you have coding skills, you can create new apps for the platform to suit your specific needs.
